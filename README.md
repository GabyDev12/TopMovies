## **Description**


<p>&nbsp;</p>

This Android app allows you to consult the billboard of a cinema, being able to obtain both information about each available film as well as those that will come out soon.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

You can also buy tickets to see the movie you want (you will have to have previously registered, with your own account of the app or with your Google account), being able to choose the day, time and seats you prefer.

Once the purchase has been made, you can download the ticket to see the film or consult the ticket later.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

In addition, you will have the possibility to customize/modify your profile, consult a list of movies you have seen and/or change the language of the application (by default it is in English but it is available in Spanish too).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

    At the beginning, the films that are currently on the **billboard** are shown, being able to access each one to obtain more information or to buy tickets to see it.

         </div>
         
         <p>&nbsp;</p>

         **By clicking on the eye** that is seen next to each ticket, a new screen will open showing the **ticket in embedded PDF format**.
         
         It will have a unique **QR code**, which must be displayed and scanned at the time of watchinv the movie at the cinema.

         <p>&nbsp;</p>

         <p>&nbsp;</p>


      - **Profile**: allows you to check the profile information.
      
         Depending on whether you are **registered Firebase user** or are **using a Google account**, it will be displayed more or less data.

         In addition, we will be able to see the total number of movies watched and we will have the option to log out.

         <p>&nbsp;</p>


      - **Settings**: if you have not logged in, only the option to **change the language** will be shown, being able to choose between **Spanish** or **English**.

         <p>&nbsp;</p>

         However, if you are **logged in with a Firebase user**, you can **edit the profile** and/or **change the password**.

         <div align="center">

         <img width=200px height=380px src="./Images/Settings-Logged-In-Firebase.png">
